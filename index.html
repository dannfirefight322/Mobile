<p class="about">My name is Daniel, and I'm an aspiring photographer from Texas. I've always been fascinated with capturing photo's since highschool. Although I never really focused on keeping a camera with at all times. It changed when my little sister was born and I bought a used Canon point and shoot camera. I was able to throw that camera in my pocket and keep it on my person most of the time.I captured some priceless moments of my kid sister's early years. I ended up upgrading to a Canon T5. This is the camera that I tend to take with me almost everywhere now. With a family that loves Disney we take trips to Disney World frequently. Which in turn gives the opportunity to take photos and practice in that environment. We also love visiting zoo's which gives me practice capturing wildlife. With two younger siblings gives me practice capturing memories of tiny humans as well. Hopefully I get the opportunity to capture memories for a long time. Thank you for taking the time to visiting my website and viewing my photos. </p>
